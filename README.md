# Craftsman Club UI/UX Styleguide

Welcome! This README won't explain any of the styles within the styleguide -- it'll just explain how to get it set up.

## Setting Up Locally

1. Clone the repo to your machine
2. `cd` into the directory where you cloned it
3. Run `grunt` to compile the Sass into vanilla CSS (make sure you've got Ruby & Sass installed)
4. Start MAMP/WAMP/etc.
5. Navigate to this page
6. Enjoy!
